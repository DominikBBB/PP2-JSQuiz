## Bugs and Fixes:

A few numbers of bugs showed up during the HTML and JS validation process.
They are all fixed, and all pages passed validation processes.
Full list of bugs and validation results after they were fixed: [Bugs and Fixes](docs/testing/TESTING-1.md)


HTML:

1. All duplicate id-atribiutes have been changed into class-atribiutes. CSS file was updated too,
2. Id="restart-button" atribiutes have been removed,
3. Empty heading was full fill with placeholder "Points",
4. <span> element has been changed into <div> element,
5. All comments which created warnings were edited. 

JS:

1. To fix warnings, /*jshint esversion: 6 */ needed to be added at the top of each js file,
2. To fix 4 undefined variables, I temporarily copied questionBank variable from separated .js file into script.js for testing purpose. Moreover, I created 3 new variables: stat, quiz and results.
3. There are 3 unused variables (calcScore, startQuiz, checkAnswers) which are onclick functions located in html file.

No more errors found.
